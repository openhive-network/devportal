| Censorship       | Vulnerable to censorship by centralized authorities | Resistant to censorship due to decentralization   |
| Scalability      | Limited scalability due to centralized infrastructure | Potential for greater scalability through decentralization |
| Transparency     | Lack of transparency in data handling      | Transparent, immutable record on the blockchain  |
| Governance       | Controlled by centralized entities         | Community-driven governance through DAOs         |
| Monetization     | Centralized monetization models (e.g., advertising) | Decentralized monetization via tokens and smart contracts |
| Intermediaries   | Relies heavily on intermediaries (e.g., social media platforms) | Removes intermediaries through decentralization   |
