  description: |
    An operation on Hive is a way of expressing intention on the blockchain.
    They are also known as Broadcast Operations.  They have types, like `vote`
    or `comment`.  They pass parameters like `author` and `permlink`, depending
    on what their purpose is.
    
    Operations are grouped into transactions and passed as parameters to
    methods like `network_broadcast_api.broadcast_transaction`, in
    the `operations` array.  Transactions must be signed in order for the
    blockchain to accept them.  Here is an example of a transaction that
    contains one operation (shown without signatures).
    
    ```json
    {
       "jsonrpc":"2.0",
       "method":"condenser_api.broadcast_transaction",
       "params":{
          "trx":{
             "ref_block_num":1097,
             "ref_block_prefix":2181793527,
             "expiration":"2016-03-24T18:00:21",
             "operations":[
                [
                   "vote",

                      "author":"alice",
                      "permlink":"a-post-by-alice",
                      "weight":10000
                   }

  ops:
    - name: vote
      virtual: false
      purpose: |
        This operation is used to cast a vote on a post/comment.  The primary
        purpose of voting is to express Proof-of-Brain about content to the
        blockchain.  When a vote is cast, the content is considered in the
        consensus rules involving author and curation rewards.
        
        A secondary aspect to voting involves reputation, which is not part of
        consensus.
        
        *Reputation Rules:*
        1. Must have non-negative reputation to effect another user's reputation.
        2. If you are down voting another user, you must have more reputation than them to impact their reputation.

        **Notes:**
        * `voter`: must be a valid account name
        * `author`: must be a valid account name
        * `permlink`: must be content created by `author`
        * `weight`: absolute value must not be more than 10000 (100.00 %).

    - name: comment
      virtual: false
      purpose: |
        Creates a post/comment.
        
        **Parameters:**
          - `parent_author` - the author that comment is being submitted to, when posting a new blog this is an empty string
          - `parent_permlink` - specific post that comment is being submitted to, when posting a new blog this is an empty string
          - `author` - author of the post/comment being submitted (account name)
          - `permlink` - unique string identifier for the post, linked to the author of the post
          - `title` - human readable title of the post being submitted, this is often blank when commenting
          - `body` - body of the post/comment being submitted, or `diff-match-patch` when updating
          - `json_metadata` - JSON object string
        
        **Rules:**
          - The "title" must not be longer than 256 bytes
          - The "title" must be UTF-8
          - The "body" must be larger than 0 bytes
          - The "body" much also be UTF-8
        
        **Additional Parameter Definitions:**
          - `permlink` - Two authors may have the same permlink as it's unique to the author only. For example, there could be two authors, alice and bob, and both could have a permlink of `firstpost`
          - `json_metadata` - There is no blockchain enforced validation on `json_metadata`, but the community has adopted a particular structure.  It should contain a JSON object with the following keys:
            - `tags` - An array of up to 5 strings. Although the blockchain will accept more than 5, the tags plugin only looks at the first five
            - `app` - A user agent style application identifier. Typically `app_name/version`, e.g. `hiveblog/0.1`
            - `format` - The format of the body, e.g. markdown
            - In addition to the above keys, application developers are free to add any other keys they want to help manage the content they broadcast.
        
        A typical `comment` operation would look similar to the below:
        
        ```json
        {
          "author": "Joe",
          "title": "A post by Joe",
          "body": "Look at my awesome post",
          "parent_author": "",
          "parent_permlink": "hiveio",
          "permlink": "a-post-by-joe",
          "json_metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"hiveio\",\"example\",\"tags\"]}"
        }
        ```
        
        #### Create vs. Update
        
        When a comment is first broadcast, the `permlink` must be unique for the `author`.  Otherwise, it is interpreted as an update operation. Updating will either replace the entire body with the latest operation or patch the body if using [`diff-match-patch`](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch).
      
        For example, if we have a paragraph that has already been broadcast:
          
        > "It's been quite a lot of fun working with these wonderful folk on the Open Hive Network"
      
        And we want to change it to:
          
        > "It's been quite a lot of fun working with these wonderful people on the Open Hive Network"
      
        We can broadcast the `comment` operation with the following `body`:
          
        ```diff
        - "@@ -406,12 +406,14 @@"
        - ful
        - -folk
        - +people
        - at
        ```
        
        The blockchain will know that this means we have changed the word 'folk' to 'people' within that paragraph so when fetching this content, this diff will be applied.
        
        In addition to body, the `title` and `json_metadata` fields will also be replaced by the latest operation.
        
        See: [`comment_options`]({{ '/apidefinitions/#broadcast_ops_comment_options' | relative_url }}), [`vote`]({{ '/apidefinitions/#broadcast_ops_vote' | relative_url }}), [`custom_json`]({{ '/apidefinitions/#broadcast_ops_custom_json' | relative_url }})
        
        It should also be noted that a `vote` operation can accompany a `comment` and `comment_options` in the same transaction when the author self votes.

        This operation converts HIVE into VFS (Vesting Fund Shares) at the
        current exchange rate. With this operation it is possible to give
        another account vesting shares so that faucets can pre-fund new accounts
        with vesting shares.
        
        **Notes:**
        * Amount must be in HIVE.
        * Must transfer a nonzero amount.

        This operation is used to report a miner who signs two blocks
        at the same time. To be valid, the violation must be reported within
        HIVE_MAX_WITNESSES blocks of the head block (1 round) and the
        producer must be in the ACTIVE witness set.
        
        Users not in the ACTIVE witness set should not have to worry about their
        key getting compromised and being used to produced multiple blocks so
        the attacker can report it and steel their vesting HIVE.
        
        The result of the operation is to transfer the full VESTING HIVE balance
        of the block producer to the reporter.

        As of HF14, allows users to share blogs they find with those who follow
        them. This change implemented entirely outside the blockchain consensus
        which means that reblogging does not create a new post, it merely shares
        an existing post with people who follow you.
        
        ##### `witness`
        
        As of HF18, the witness plugin has a custom operation called
        `enable_content_editing` that allows a user to signal they want to edit
        their content. By consensus, content is editable indefinitely, but is
        soft forked to be frozen after payout. This operation requires an
        `active` key and is designed to prevent vandalism if a posting key is
        compromised. [#1017]({{ 'https://github.com/steemit/steem/issues/1017' | archived_url }})

        Authors of posts may not want all of the benefits that come from creating a post. This
        operation allows authors to update properties associated with their post.
        
        Typically, these options will accompany a `comment` operation in the same transaction.
        
        As of HF17, content can specify beneficiaries to receive a part of
        their author rewards. The beneficiaries are specified in the extension
        field of the `comment_options_operation` and is a sorted vector (by
        account name) of account name, weight pairs. The beneficiaries can only
        be specified once and must be specified before any votes are cast on the
        comment. Most apps are already adding a `comment_options` in the
        transaction that creates the comment, so this should not be much of a
        challenge to add to existing apps.

          * When the symbol is not allowed in the list for votable assets: *"HIVE can not be explicitly specified as one of allowed_vote_assets"*
        * `max_accepted_payout`: HBD value of the maximum payout this post will receive
        * `percent_hbd`: the percent of Hive Dollars to key, unkept amounts will be received as Hive Power
        * `allow_votes`: allows/disallows a post to receive votes;

          * Cannot have more than 127 (witness currently only allow up to 8).
          * Cannot allocate more than 100% of rewards to one account.
          * Cannot allocate more than 100% of rewards to a comment.
          * Must be specified in sorted order (account ascending; no duplicates).

    - name: request_account_recovery
      since: HF11
      virtual: false
      purpose: |
        All account recovery requests come from a listed recovery account. This
        is secure based on the assumption that only a trusted account should be
        a recovery account. It is the responsibility of the recovery account to
        verify the identity of the account holder of the account to recover by
        whichever means they have agreed upon. The blockchain assumes identity
        has been verified when this operation is broadcast.
        
        This operation creates an account recovery request which the account to
        recover has 24 hours to respond to before the request expires and is
        invalidated.
        
        There can only be one active recovery request per account at any one time.
        Pushing this operation for an account to recover when it already has
        an active request will either update the request to a new new owner authority
        and extend the request expiration to 24 hours from the current head block
        time or it will delete the request. To cancel a request, simply set the
        weight threshold of the new owner authority to 0, making it an open authority.
        
        Additionally, the new owner authority must be satisfiable. In other words,
        the sum of the key weights must be greater than or equal to the weight
        threshold.
        
        This operation only needs to be signed by the the recovery account.
        The account to recover confirms its identity to the blockchain in
        the recover account operation.
        
        **Notes:**
        
        * `recovery_account`: The recovery account is listed as the recovery account
          on the account to recover.
        * `account_to_recover`: The account to recover. This is likely due to a
          compromised owner authority.
        * `new_owner_authority`: The new owner authority the account to recover
          wishes to have. This is secret known by the account to recover and
          will be confirmed in a `recover_account`.

        Each account lists another account as their recovery account.
        The recovery account has the ability to create `account_recovery_requests`
        for the account to recover. An account can change their recovery account
        at any time with a 30 day delay. This delay is to prevent
        an attacker from changing the recovery account to a malicious account
        during an attack. These 30 days match the 30 days that an
        owner authority is valid for recovery purposes.
        
        On account creation the recovery account is set either to the creator of
        the account (The account that pays the creation fee and is a signer on the transaction)
        or to the empty string if the account was mined. An account with no recovery
        has the top voted witness as a recovery account, at the time the recover
        request is created. Note: This does mean the effective recovery account
        of an account with no listed recovery account can change at any time as
        witness vote weights. The top voted witness is explicitly the most trusted
        witness according to stake.

        The purpose of this operation is to enable someone to send money
        contingently to another individual. The funds leave the *from* account
        and go into a temporary balance where they are held until *from*
        releases it to *to* or *to* refunds it to *from*.
        
        In the event of a dispute the *agent* can divide the funds between the
        to/from account. Disputes can be raised any time before or on the
        dispute deadline time, after the escrow has been approved by all
        parties.
        
        This operation only creates a proposed escrow transfer. Both the *agent*
        and *to* must agree to the terms of the arrangement by approving the
        escrow.
        
        The escrow agent is paid the fee on approval of all parties. It is up to
        the escrow agent to determine the fee.
        
        Escrow transactions are uniquely identified by `from` and `escrow_id`,
        the `escrow_id` is defined by the sender.

        The permission scheme is as follows:
          * If there is no dispute and escrow has not expired, either party can
            release funds to the other.
          * If escrow expires and there is no dispute, either party can release
            funds to either party.
          * If there is a dispute regardless of expiration, the agent can
            release funds to either party following whichever agreement was in place between the parties.
        
        After the expiration, the receiver can use this operation to claim the funds.  If the funds are not claimed by the receiver within 1 month of expiration then the sender can reclaim the funds.

        For time locked savings accounts. A user can place Hive and Hive
        Dollars into time locked savings balances. Funds can be withdrawn from
        these balances after a three day delay. The point of this addition is to
        mitigate loss from hacked and compromised account. The max a user can
        lose instantaneously is the sum of what the hold in liquid balances.
        Assuming an account can be recovered quickly, loss in such situations
        can be kept to a minimum.

        **Deprecated as of HF20** If an account creation service would still like to provide a delegation of Hive Power
        to the accounts they create, they can still follow the account creation operation with an additional call to
        `delegate_vesting_shares` to add a delegation of HP to the account.

        >Instead of paying the entire account creation fee with Hive, creators
        can now pay a smaller fee (30x less) and delegate some Hive Power for
        30 days. The exact amount is 5 * min_fee + HIVE_POWER == 150 * min_fee.
        You can pay any combination of HIVE and Hive Power along that curve
        (so long as the minimum fee is paid).

        >*The witness voted HIVE fee is now the minimum required HIVE fee for
        delegation. Witnesses should reduce their fee by 30x when the hardfork
        goes live to preserve the same required fee for an all HIVE account
        creation.*

    - name: smt_create
      since: Mysterious Future
      virtual: false
      purpose: |
        Create a Smart Media Token.
        
        This operation introduces new SMT into blockchain as identified by Numerical Asset Identifier (NAI). Also the SMT precision (decimal points) is explicitly provided.
        
        #### Initial Case
        
        The first operation to be executed is an `smt_create` operation.  This operation creates an SMT object in the blockchain state.  After executing this operation, the newly created SMT object is not yet fully configured.
        
        Most of the configuration occurs in subsequent operations (`smt_set_setup_parameters`, `smt_setup_inflation`, and `smt_setup`). These later operations may occur in the same transaction, but they may also occur at any later point in time.
        
        #### Reset Case
        
        Re-issuing `smt_create` with zero `smt_creation_fee` and the NAI of a token in the initial setup will reset emmisions and setup state.  This is useful for token creators who have put their token in an unlaunchable state.
        
        This will allow deleting of emission schedules with and changing of precision if there are no emission objects already created.
        
        **Parameters:**
        * `control_account` - The name of the controlling account.
        * `symbol` - The asset symbol of the created token.
        * `smt_creation_fee` - The amount to be transfered from @account to null account as elevation fee.  The amount required is set by the `smt_creation_fee` field of the `dynamic_global_properties` object.  This field may contain a value in HIVE or HBD.
        * `precision` - Separately provided precision for clarity and redundancy.

A separate virtual operation is issued for the author, the curators and the beneficiaries (see [author_reward]({{ '/apidefinitions/#broadcast_ops_author_reward' | relative_url }}), [comment_benefactor_reward]({{ '/apidefinitions/#broadcast_ops_comment_benefactor_reward' | relative_url }}) and [curation_reward]({{ '/apidefinitions/#broadcast_ops_curation_reward' | relative_url }})).
        
        The value is the equivalent HBD value of the payout even if no HBD will be effectively paid to the author, curators, or beneficiaries.

        Issued when a Proposals Fund (DHF) conversion from HIVE to HBD occurs.
        
        When the Hardfork that created Hive happened back in March 2020, the Steemit Inc ninja-mined funds were moved into the @hive.fund account as a development fund.  As proposals are paid in HBD and most of the moved funds were in HIVE, an automatic conversion process has been put in place.

        The `collateralized_convert` operation is similar to `convert` operation (see: [convert]({{ '/apidefinitions/#broadcast_ops_convert' | relative_url }})), and instructs the blockchain to convert HIVE to HBD.  The operation is performed after a 3.5 days delay, but the owner gets HBD immediately.  The price risk is cushioned by extra HIVE.  After actual conversion takes place the excess HIVE is returned to the owner.
