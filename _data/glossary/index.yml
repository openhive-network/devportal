When a transaction is submitted to the Hive blockchain, it is signed by the account owner using their private key. The blockchain is able to determine that the transaction is valid by validating the signature against the public key from the pair.
    - term: Public Key

    - term: Reward Pool
      def: Every day, a fixed amount of HIVE tokens are allocated to the network reward fund, commonly called the "reward pool." These get distributed to authors and curators for posting and voting on content.
    - term: AppBase
      def: Plug-in architecture that provides a robust foundation for scaling.  It enables many components of the Hive blockchain to become modular by creating additional non-consensus blockchains as dedicated plugins.

    - term: MIRA
      def: Multi Index Rocksdb Adapter (removed in HF25) that updates the database backend of Hive from memory mapped files to a disk log-structured merge-tree implemented via the RocksDB library.
    - term: Manabar
      def: |
        <p>
          Tracked voting power that is regenerated from 0 to 100% of max
          linearly over 5 days.  It is a function of Hive Power, delegations,
          and active power down that tracks unspent reward fund shares.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Each user also has a manabar specifically for downvotes, which is 25%
          of the upvote manabar.  Downvotes will consume this mana first before
          consuming regular mana.  When voting, 1/50<sup>th</sup> of the
          remaining mana is used for a 100% vote.  The same math is used for
          downvote mana but multiplied by 4 because the downvote manabar is 25%
          the size of the normal manabar.  The maximum of these values is used.
          When both manabars are at 100%, the values are the same.  When
          downvote mana runs out, normal mana is then used.
        </p>
