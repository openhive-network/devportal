Hive Engine is a smart contracts side-chain platform for the Hive blockchain. This means that it can execute custom smart 
contracts based on data published to the Hive blockchain. This allows us to do things that are not currently supported 
by the Hive blockchain, such as creating custom tokens, or literally anything else achievable with a smart contract.
