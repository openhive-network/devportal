**Developer Advocate**

The members of the Hive Inc. development team are currently the main contributors to the Hive blockchain software. They oversee the open source [Hive](https://github.com/steemit/steem) GitHub repository, and maintain many of the open source [libraries](https://github.com/steemit) that developers use.

Hiveâ€™s [Developer Advocate](mailto:da@hive.blog) is here to make the process of developing for the Hive platform as smooth as possible. If you have any comments, concerns, or suggestions about how to improve the experience of developing applications with the Hive blockchain - please [reach out](mailto:da@hive.blog). 

The D.A. receives a lot of emails, but will respond as quickly as possible.
