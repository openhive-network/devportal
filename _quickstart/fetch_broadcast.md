#### Fetching data

Fetching blockchain data with help of SDK libraries, couldn't be much simpler and easy to do. Nodejs and Python libraries
help any developer to quickly access Blockchain data and do analysis or create apps using those data. SDK by default utilizes
JSON-RPC to make a request to Hive nodes. Community has created [REST API alternatives](https://hivexplorer.com/api-docs) as well which could easily be integrated
with any app on any framework or application.

#### Broadcast data

Broadcasting or Set, modifying blockchain data could be done directly with above SDK libraries as well. Broadcasting or making 
any modification into account require user's private key. Using [Authentication services]({{ '/quickstart/#quickstart-authentication' | relative_url }}) highly recommended in this use-cases.

By utilizing Authenticating services, you can eliminate or give more confidence to user, so they are assured their keys are safe.
They can securely interact with your application, website or service.
